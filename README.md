# bunny-letters
Bunny Letters is a simple, hangman-style word game. 
 
The project was developed for the purpose of learning Java basics, especially classes, objects, and error handling. I created it with the intention of making a GUI but for now, it is console only.

Code will be cleaned up and more thoroughly commented soon.
